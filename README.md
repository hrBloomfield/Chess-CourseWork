## Overview

This project is a desktop chess application developed to simulate both traditional over-the-board play and single-player experiences against a basic AI opponent. Designed with portability in mind, it removes the need for a physical board and adds convenience features such as game saving, FEN position loading, and in-game feedback.

## FEN Integration

This project makes extensive use of FEN strings to manage game state. A FEN string such as:

```
rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1
```

...encodes:
- **Piece positions**
- **Whose turn it is**
- **Castling availability**
- **En passant targets**
- **Halfmove clock** (for 50-move rule)
- **Fullmove number**

FEN input/output allows users to:
- Start from any arbitrary position
- Save their current game state
- Replay historical games
- Test specific tactical or endgame scenarios

- No moving into or through check
